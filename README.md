# Archi MCP Server

An Eclipse PDE plugin for [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/) that exposes ArchiMate models through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), enabling LLMs to query, analyse, and modify enterprise architecture models through natural language.

## What It Does

Archi MCP Server embeds an HTTP server inside Archi that speaks MCP. Once running, any MCP-compatible LLM client (Claude, Cline, LM Studio, etc.) can connect and interact with the currently open ArchiMate model — asking questions, searching elements, traversing relationships, composing view diagrams, and even creating or modifying model content.

The server provides **69 MCP tools** across querying, searching, creating, layout, routing, assessment, batch operations, images, specializations, and more — plus **14 MCP resources** with ArchiMate reference material, workflow guides, and a viewpoint recipe library for LLMs.

**Example conversation:**

> **You:** "What applications support the Customer Portal capability?"
>
> **LLM:** Searches elements, traverses relationships, and returns: *"7 applications support Customer Portal: OrderService, PaymentGateway, ..."*

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/) | 5.7+ |
| Java | 21+ |
| An MCP-compatible LLM client | Claude CLI, Cline, LM Studio, etc. |

**LLM model size recommendation:** 8B+ parameters minimum, 14B+ for reliable tool calling, 70B+ for complex view composition workflows.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `.archiplugin` from the [Releases](../../releases) page (or the `bin/` directory for pre-built artifacts)
2. In Archi: **Help > Manage Plug-ins > Install New...** or copy to Archi's `dropins/` folder
3. Restart Archi

## Getting Started

### 1. Start the Server

Open an ArchiMate model in Archi, then:

**Menu:** `MCP Server > Start MCP Server`

The **MCP Server** entry in Archi's menu bar has three items:

| Menu item | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Start MCP Server** | Starts the embedded server; toggles to **Stop MCP Server** while running. |
| **Approval Mode** | Checkable toggle for the human-owned approval gate. When on, the agent's changes queue for your review instead of applying immediately — see [Mutation Safety](#mutation-safety). |
| **Pending approvals (N)** | Opens the **Pending Approvals** dock view; `N` is the live count of changes awaiting your decision. |

Server behaviour (port, bind address, TLS, authentication, …) is configured separately under **Window > Preferences > MCP Server** — see [Configuration](#configuration). The default endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:18090`.

### 2. Configure Your LLM Client

#### Claude Code (CLI)

In your project's `.mcp.json` or `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "archi": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:18090/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Or via the CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http archi http://127.0.0.1:18090/mcp
```

#### Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop does not natively support Streamable HTTP, so a proxy is required. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (a single Rust binary), then add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

**Windows:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "archi": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\YOUR_USER\\.local\\bin\\uvx.exe",
      "args": ["mcp-proxy", "--transport", "streamablehttp", "http://127.0.0.1:18090/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**macOS:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "archi": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-proxy", "--transport", "streamablehttp", "http://127.0.0.1:18090/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cline / Other MCP Clients

Point your MCP client at the Streamable-HTTP endpoint:

```
http://127.0.0.1:18090/mcp
```

SSE transport is also available at `/sse` for older clients.

### 3. Start Querying

With the server running and your LLM client connected, you can ask questions in natural language:

- *"Give me an overview of this architecture model"*
- *"Find all Application Services in the model"*
- *"What does the Order Processing component depend on?"*
- *"Show me the relationships between the CRM and ERP systems"*
- *"Create a new view showing the payment processing flow"*
- *"Auto-layout and route the connections on this view"*

## Configuration

Access via **Window > Preferences > MCP Server** in Archi.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Port** | `18090` | HTTP(S) server port |
| **Bind Address** | `127.0.0.1` | Network interface (localhost only by default) |
| **Auto-Start** | `false` | Start the server automatically when Archi launches |
| **Log Level** | `INFO` | Logging verbosity: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR` |
| **Enable TLS** | `false` | Use HTTPS with TLS encryption |
| **Keystore File** | *(empty)* | Path to PKCS12/JKS keystore (auto-generated if using self-signed) |
| **Keystore Password** | *(empty)* | Password for the keystore file, stored in your OS keychain via Equinox secure storage (no separate password to manage) — never written to disk in cleartext |
| **Enable bearer-token authentication** | `false` | Require an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header on every request (see below) |

### TLS / HTTPS

The server supports optional TLS encryption. To enable:

1. In preferences, check **Enable TLS (HTTPS)**
2. Click **Generate Self-Signed Certificate** to create a keystore automatically
3. Restart the server — the endpoint changes to `https://127.0.0.1:18090`

Clients must trust the self-signed certificate. For `curl` testing, use the `-k` flag. For LLM clients, import the certificate into the client's trust store or the JVM `cacerts`.

The keystore password (whether you type it or generate it with the button) is stored in your OS keychain via Equinox secure storage — the same store the bearer token and Archi itself use — not in the plaintext preference file. If you had a keystore password set in an earlier version, it is migrated automatically on first start.

### Enabling authentication (bearer token)

By default the server requires no authentication — anything that can reach the port can call the tools, which is why the default bind is loopback only. If you bind to a non-loopback address, or simply want a secret required even on loopback, enable an **opt-in bearer token**:

1. In **Window > Preferences > MCP Server > Authentication**, check **Enable bearer-token authentication**. A 256-bit token is generated automatically on first opt-in and stored in your OS keychain (via Equinox secure storage — no separate password to manage).
2. Click **Copy** to copy the token, or **Generate / Regenerate token** to roll it (regenerating invalidates clients still using the old token).
3. Restart the server. Every request to `/mcp` and `/sse` must now send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; a missing, malformed, or wrong token gets `401`.

Configure your clients to send the header:

**Claude Code (CLI):**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http archi http://127.0.0.1:18090/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

**Claude Code (`.mcp.json` / `~/.claude.json`):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "archi": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:18090/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <token>" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Desktop (via `mcp-proxy`)** — pass the header through the proxy:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "archi": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-proxy", "--transport", "streamablehttp", "--headers", "Authorization", "Bearer <token>", "http://127.0.0.1:18090/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**`curl` (testing):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18090/mcp -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0"}}}'
```

Authentication is **off by default** — existing configs without an `Authorization` header keep working unchanged until you enable it. On a non-loopback bind, also enable TLS so the token is not sent in cleartext.

### Security model

The server exposes mutating and file-touching tools over HTTP, so the trust
boundary is worth understanding. [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) states what the
server protects against by default (loopback bind, Origin/Host validation,
request/session/image resource limits, the human-owned approval gate) versus
what is your responsibility as the operator (transport encryption, client
authentication, securing a non-loopback bind), and how to report a
vulnerability. Read it before binding off-loopback or pointing an agent at
untrusted input.

## Available Tools

The server exposes **69 MCP tools** organised into functional categories.

### Query & Model Inspection (6 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `get-model-info` | Model overview — name, `purpose`, custom `properties`, element/relationship/view counts by type and layer, plus specialization count. Read counterpart to `update-model` |
| `get-element` | Retrieve element(s) by ID (single via `id` or batch via `ids` array) |
| `get-views` | List views with optional viewpoint type or name filtering |
| `get-view-contents` | View diagram contents — elements, relationships, visual positions, connection routing, image visuals, and the full styling surface (typography, gradient, alignment, line style, `labelExpression`) so styling mutations can be read back and verified. `format: "tree"` returns the containment hierarchy, descending both visual groups **and** ArchiMate-element containers — nested children appear in the parent node's `children` array with a `childCount`. Graph nodes and edges also carry their visual identifiers (`viewObjectId` on nodes, `viewConnectionId` on edges) so a returned visual can be fed straight into `remove-from-view` / `update-view-object` / `update-view-connection` without a second lookup |
| `get-relationships` | Traverse relationships with configurable depth (0-3 hops) or multi-hop chain traversal with direction/type/layer filters |
| `find-concept-usage` | Reverse where-used lookup — given an element or relationship ID, returns every view and visual object/connection that references it. Inverse of `get-view-contents`. Use before `delete-element` / `delete-relationship` / rename / re-type to see the cross-view footprint in one round-trip |

### Search & Discovery (4 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `search-elements` | Full-text search across element names, documentation, and properties with optional type, layer, and `specialization` filters |
| `search-relationships` | Search all relationships by text, type, source/target element layer, and `specialization` — no element ID needed |
| `get-or-create-element` | Discovery-first — returns existing element if exact name+type match exists, otherwise creates new |
| `search-and-create` | Combined search + conditional create with duplicate candidate display |

### Element & Relationship Creation (4 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `create-element` | Create an ArchiMate element with type validation and duplicate detection. Optional `specialization` parameter auto-creates the specialization on first use |
| `create-relationship` | Create a relationship with ArchiMate specification rule enforcement. Optional `specialization` parameter auto-creates the specialization on first use. Optional type-conditional semantic attributes: `accessType` (AccessRelationship), `associationDirected` (AssociationRelationship), `influenceStrength` (InfluenceRelationship) |
| `create-view` | Create a new diagram view with optional viewpoint and connection router type |
| `clone-view` | Duplicate an existing view with all visual contents (elements, groups, notes, connections, bendpoints, styling). The clone references the same model objects |

### Element, Relationship, View & Model Updates (4 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `update-element` | Update element name, documentation, properties, or `specialization` (pass `""` to clear) |
| `update-relationship` | Update relationship name, documentation, properties, or `specialization` (pass `""` to clear). Optional type-conditional semantic attributes: `accessType` (AccessRelationship), `associationDirected` (AssociationRelationship), `influenceStrength` (InfluenceRelationship). Source, target, and type are immutable |
| `update-view` | Update view name, viewpoint, documentation, properties, or connection router type |
| `update-model` | Update the loaded model's own `name`, `purpose`, and custom `properties` as a single undo unit. At least one of the three must be provided; omitted fields stay unchanged. Empty-string `purpose` clears the field; null property values remove a key |

### ArchiMate Specializations (5 tools)

Specializations are IS-A subtypes of ArchiMate concept types (e.g. "Microservice" is a kind of `ApplicationComponent`, "Cloud Server" is a kind of `Node`). Use them to classify the *kind of thing* an element is — not for per-instance attributes like environment or version. See `archimate://reference/archimate-specializations` for the full guide.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `list-specializations` | List every specialization defined on the model with `(name, conceptType, layer, usageCount, imagePath)`. Optional `conceptType` filter |
| `create-specialization` | Define a specialization explicitly without creating any element. Idempotent on duplicate `(name, conceptType)` — useful for pre-registering vocabulary at session start. Optional `imagePath` sets the specialization's icon (Archi renders it on every concept of that specialization) |
| `update-specialization` | Rename a specialization and/or set its icon. Refuses to merge into an existing target name. Existing references move with the rename. Optional `imagePath` (set/change icon) and `clearImagePath: true` (explicit clear) — mutually exclusive. At least one of `newName`, `imagePath`, or `clearImagePath` must be supplied |
| `delete-specialization` | Delete a specialization. Refuses by default if any concept uses it; pass `force: true` to detach references and delete in one atomic command |
| `get-specialization-usage` | Audit query — lists every element and relationship referencing a specialization. Call before rename or delete |

### View Composition (9 tools)

All view-composition tools that place a new visual object (`add-to-view`, `add-group-to-view`, `add-note-to-view`, `add-view-reference-to-view`, `add-image-to-view`) and `update-view-object` accept the full visual styling surface: fill / line / font colour, opacity, line width, line style (`solid` / `dashed` / `dotted` / `none`), typography (`fontName`, `fontSize`, `fontStyle`), gradient, `deriveLineColor`, `outlineOpacity`, `figureType` (`rectangular` / `tabbed`), `textAlignment`, `verticalTextAlignment`, plus note-specific `borderType` (`dogear` / `rectangle` / `none`). Existing calls are byte-identical; supply only the fields you want to set. Every one of these fields reads back through `get-view-contents`, so a styling mutation can be verified after the write.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `add-to-view` | Place a model element onto a view diagram (same element can appear on multiple views). Optional `imagePath`, `imagePosition`, `showIcon` for custom icon overlays, and `labelExpression` for a per-view-object dynamic label template (e.g. `"${name}"`, `"${property:Owner}"`) |
| `add-group-to-view` | Add a visual grouping rectangle (pure visual container, no model representation). Optional `imagePath`, `imagePosition`, and `showIcon` for custom icon overlays |
| `add-note-to-view` | Add a text note annotation (pure visual, no model representation). Optional `imagePath`, `imagePosition`, `showIcon`, and note-specific `borderType` |
| `add-view-reference-to-view` | Embed another ArchiMate view as a clickable thumbnail (the agent-driven equivalent of Archi GUI's drag-view-onto-view). Requires `viewId` (target) and `referencedViewId` (source). The referenced view's name is not stored on the visual — renaming the referenced view auto-updates every embedding |
| `add-image-to-view` | Add a standalone image as a first-class diagram node (sibling to notes, groups, and view-references). Requires `viewId` and an `imagePath` returned by `add-image-to-model` or `list-model-images`. Default size is the image's natural dimensions; typo'd paths are rejected with `IMAGE_NOT_FOUND`. Distinct from `update-view-object`'s `imagePath`, which sets an icon overlay on an existing element |
| `add-connection-to-view` | Add a visual connection representing an existing model relationship, with optional styling, label suppression, and label positioning |
| `update-view-object` | Update position, size, styling, image, and/or `labelExpression` of a visual element on a view |
| `update-view-connection` | Replace bendpoints, update styling, toggle label visibility, and/or set label position of a connection on a view |
| `apply-positions` | Apply a complete visual layout atomically (up to 10,000 entries per call) |

### View Cleanup (2 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `remove-from-view` | Remove a visual element or connection from a view (model object preserved) |
| `clear-view` | Remove all visual elements and connections from a view (model objects preserved) |

### Layout & Routing (11 tools)

> **LLM agents:** Fetch `archimate://prompts/routing-preconditions-checklist` before invoking `auto-route-connections` or `auto-layout-and-route` on any non-trivial view. The routing pipeline cannot recover from missing preconditions — it can only route the geometry the agent has set up. The spacing convenience tools self-terminate honestly: if a view is provably too dense for spacing to fix they return `terminationReason: density_floor_reflow_required` and offer a user-consentable structural reflow — surface that to the user instead of looping the spacing tools.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `auto-route-connections` | Orthogonal connection routing using clearance-weighted visibility-graph A* pathfinding with corridor directionality, corridor diversity, group-wall awareness, channel-global ordered nudging, and post-routing path straightening. Two modes: `mode: "full"` (default) re-routes whole connections via visibility-graph A*; `mode: "terminals-only"` rectifies only the first/last bendpoint of each connection to make terminal segments orthogonal — best after ELK on grouped views to fix diagonal terminal entries without the crossing inflation a full re-route causes. Optional `autoNudge` mode automatically moves blocking elements (and resizes parent groups to contain them) and re-routes failed connections in a single atomic operation. The response carries a `structuredWarnings: List<{code, message, remediationTool, remediationViolatorIds}>` field for deterministic LLM iteration (most common: `AUTO_NUDGE_SKIPPED_SIBLING_OVERLAP` instructing the agent to run `layout-within-group` on the parent before re-routing) |
| `auto-layout-and-route` | Two modes: `auto` (default) uses ELK Layered to compute positions AND routes in one operation; `grouped` orchestrates the full grouped-view workflow (layout-within-group + arrange-groups + optimize-group-order + auto-route-connections) atomically. Smart iteration when `targetRating` is set — factor-aware iteration tunes the right knob per tier, with plateau detection to exit early when iterations stop improving the dominant tier |
| `layout-within-group` | Arrange child elements inside a container using row, column, or grid patterns. The container may be a visual group **or** an ArchiMate-element container (`ApplicationComponent`, `Node`, `ApplicationFunction`, etc.) that holds nested children — the same `arrangement` / `spacing` / `padding` / `columns` / `autoResize` / `autoWidth` semantics apply to both. Notes, view-references, and connections are rejected as containers |
| `layout-flat-view` | Automatic layout for flat (non-grouped) views — row, column, or grid arrangement with optional sorting by name/type/layer and category grouping |
| `arrange-groups` | Position top-level groups relative to each other in grid, row, or column layout. **Density-aware default:** when `spacing` is omitted on a view with inter-group connections, the tool derives a connection-count-aware default (≤ 15 → 80 px, 16–30 → 100 px, > 30 → 120 px). Pass an explicit `spacing` to suppress |
| `optimize-group-order` | Reorder elements within groups to minimise inter-group edge crossings |
| `resize-elements-to-fit` | Resize all (or selected) elements on a view to fit their labels using SWT font metrics. Two-pass algorithm for nested containment: children first, then parents. Optional `wrapFit: true` keeps each element's width and grows only its height so a long label wraps onto extra lines instead of being clipped or forced into an over-wide box — useful for nested labels in fixed-width containers (after a parent grows to contain a wrapped child, follow with `auto-route-connections`). **Sizes for label legibility only — not for connection fan-out.** For hub elements with high connection counts, use `detect-hub-elements` plus `update-view-object` |
| `adjust-view-spacing` | Inflate inter-element and inter-group spacing on an existing view, then re-route in a single atomic operation. Use when a view is correctly laid out but visually cramped, without re-running ELK from scratch and losing manual placement intent. **Density-aware default:** when `interElementDelta` is omitted on a view with `coincidentSegmentCount > 2` or `connectionEdgeCoincidenceCount > 4`, the tool derives a connection-count-aware default (≤ 15 → 60 px target, 16–30 → 80 px, > 30 → 100 px). Pass `interElementDelta: 0` to suppress. After spacing inflation, a post-pass detects any child element that overflows its parent group bounds and resizes the parent (B15 closure) |
| `apply-element-spacing-recommendations` | Convenience tool that runs an embedded observe → decide → density-aware-terminate control loop to inflate within-group element spacing. Per iteration it takes a small monotone step, re-runs `assess-layout`, and continues / escalates / stops; a degrading step is always reverted. Hub-aware tier selection (80/100/120 px) when `detect-hub-elements` reports candidates. Returns before/after `assess-layout` snapshots plus `terminationReason` / `iterationCount` / `appliedDeltas[]`. One call = one undo step. Set `dryRun: true` to preview |
| `apply-group-spacing-recommendations` | Sibling-symmetric convenience tool that runs the same embedded control loop to widen inter-group corridors only — preserves group ordering and topology. Hub-aware connected-pair tier rises to 100/140/160 px. Returns before/after `assess-layout` snapshots plus `terminationReason` / `iterationCount` / `appliedDeltas[]`. `dryRun: true` previews. With hub sizing and `apply-element-spacing-recommendations` this completes the routing-preconditions triad |
| `apply-spacing-recommendations` | Composed convenience tool that runs TWO coordinated control loops (element arm, then inter-group arm) in one transactional call. The `scope` parameter (`both` / `element` / `group`) selects which arm(s) run. The inflation-knee constants are **per-iteration step caps** (+80 px element / +100 px inter-group per iteration), preventing cumulative-inflation-past-the-knee without a fixed per-call ceiling; `elementKneeClampApplied` / `groupKneeClampApplied` surface when a step cap fires. Reports per-arm `terminationReason` / iteration counts / applied deltas. Use when both axes need adjustment; single-arm siblings cover single-axis changes |

### Layout Assessment & Analysis (2 tools)

> Metric acronyms below — M1–M6, R8, `parallelConnectionGap_V_p10` (V_p10), HPQ — are defined in the [glossary](docs/glossary.md).

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `assess-layout` | Assess view layout quality across the legacy 8-metric severity-tiered rating (overlaps, crossings, pass-throughs, coincident segments, non-orthogonal terminals, spacing, alignment, label overlaps) plus the perception-aligned metrics (M1 visible-segment-length non-orthogonal terminals, M2 interior terminations, M3 zigzags, M4 connection-vs-edge coincidence, M5 hub-port quality, R8 corridor utilisation) and the M6 two-dimensional rating (layout tier × routing tier). Also reports the informational `parallelConnectionGap_V_p10` signal (10th-percentile parallel-segment gap on the V axis, anchored at 13.30 px on the ArchiMate reference) for narrow-corridor regime detection. Informational detections cover label truncation, parent-label obscured by child, and image sibling overlap. M3 (zigzag) skips connections already classified as pass-throughs so a single connection is not double-labelled. Self-element pass-throughs are reported but excluded from rating. The `nextSteps[]` envelope names the right precondition tool with violator IDs attached when an overlap, boundary violation, low hub-port-quality score, or grouped-view spacing/crossing breach is detected. Optional `includeViolatorIds` returns per-metric visual object IDs for targeted fixes |
| `detect-hub-elements` | Identify hub elements by counting visual connections per element, sorted descending. Hub thresholds: ≥ 5 connections is a hub candidate; > 6 connections gets an explicit 1D sizing suggestion `baseDimension + 15px × (connectionCount − 6)`; for elements with > 12 connections the response also surfaces a 2D-resize suggestion (`width += 15 × ⌈excess/2⌉`, `height += 15 × ⌊excess/2⌋`) so the agent can distribute ports across all four edges. The assessor's internal `M5_FACE_GUARD_MIN_CONNECTIONS = 4` is a separate per-face guard for the M5 hub-port-quality metric, not a hub-detection threshold |

### View Operations (1 tool)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `auto-connect-view` | Create visual connections for all existing model relationships between elements already placed on a view. Optional `showLabel: false` to suppress labels, and optional `lineColor`, `fontColor`, `lineWidth` to batch-style every connection it creates (combine with `relationshipTypes` filter to style by type) |

### Folder Management (5 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `get-folders` | List folders (root-level by default, or children of a specific folder) |
| `get-folder-tree` | Folder hierarchy as a nested tree structure |
| `create-folder` | Create a new subfolder |
| `update-folder` | Update folder name, documentation, or properties |
| `move-to-folder` | Move a model object (element, relationship, view, or folder) to a different parent folder |

### Deletion (4 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `delete-element` | Delete an element — cascades relationships and view references across all views |
| `delete-relationship` | Delete a relationship — cascades view connections across all views |
| `delete-view` | Delete a view and its visual contents (model elements preserved) |
| `delete-folder` | Delete a folder (requires `force: true` for non-empty folders) |

### Export (1 tool)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `export-view` | Render a view as PNG, JPG, SVG, or PDF — returned inline (base64 / blob) or written to file. Optional `quality` (1–100, default 90) for JPEG encoding; ignored for other formats. Vector formats (SVG, PDF) leave `width`/`height` unset because they are resolution-independent. Optional `outputDirectory` controls where files are saved (auto-creates directories; defaults to temp). SVG and PDF require the `com.archimatetool.export.svg` bundle that ships with Archi 5.7+ |

### Images (2 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `add-image-to-model` | Import an image (icon) into the model archive. Preferred: `filePath` (local file) or `url` (HTTP download) — these bypass LLM text channel and avoid base64 corruption. Fallback: `imageData` (base64). Provide exactly ONE. Returns the archive `imagePath` for use with view composition tools. Images are deduplicated |
| `list-model-images` | List all images stored in the model archive with their paths and dimensions. Use the `imagePath` values with view composition tools to set images on elements, groups, or notes without re-importing |

### Batch & Mutation Control (4 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `begin-batch` | Start batch mode — mutations are queued instead of applied immediately |
| `end-batch` | Commit all queued mutations atomically, or rollback (discard all) |
| `get-batch-status` | Check operational mode and queued operation count |
| `bulk-mutate` | Execute multiple mutations as a single compound command with 0-indexed back-references (`$N.id` resolves to the result of operation N; a create tool cannot reference its own not-yet-created result) and optional `continueOnError` |

### Undo / Redo (2 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `undo` | Undo the most recent mutation operation(s) with optional step count. **Scoped to the agent's own changes:** stops at — and refuses to cross — any human edit on the stack, so the agent can never silently revert hand-drawn work (to undo a human change it must submit a new proposal). The human's native Ctrl+Z is unscoped and still undoes anything |
| `redo` | Redo previously undone operation(s). Scoped to the agent's own changes, symmetric to `undo` |

### Approval Workflow (1 tool)

The approval **gate is owned by the human** in Archi (a desktop toggle), not by the agent. The MCP surface exposes only a read-only observation tool — the agent can see that changes are gated but cannot enable/disable the gate or approve its own queued changes.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `list-pending-approvals` | List pending mutation proposals awaiting the human's approval (read-only) |

### Session Management (2 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `set-session-filter` | Set persistent filters and field selection that apply to all subsequent queries |
| `get-session-filters` | Retrieve currently active session-scoped filters and field selection |

### Response Control

All query tools support response optimisation parameters:

- **Field selection:** `fields` param with presets (`minimal`, `standard`, `full`) or custom field arrays
- **Field exclusion:** `exclude` param to omit specific fields
- **Pagination:** Automatic for large result sets, with cursor-based continuation

### Viewpoint Recipes

A progressive-disclosure recipe library for laying out non-conventional ArchiMate viewpoints. Fetch the index first; it states the invariant build sequence once, routes conventional viewpoints (layered, landscape, hierarchy, information structure) to the view-patterns principles, and points non-conventional viewpoints to a single full recipe page with the topology block to match.

## Mutation Safety

All write operations integrate with Archi's **CommandStack**, making every mutation **undoable** via `Ctrl+Z` in Archi or the `undo` / `redo` tools.

**Approval mode** adds a human-in-the-loop gate that the **human owns** — the agent operates tools but can never move the gate or approve its own changes:

```
Human toggles "Approval Mode" ON in Archi (MCP Server menu)
  → agent's mutations queue as "pending" (not applied)
  → agent calls list-pending-approvals → sees what's gated, tells the user to confirm in Archi
  → human approves/rejects in Archi → apply, or discard
```

The toggle lives only on the human side: there is no MCP tool to enable/disable approval or to approve a proposal. Your choice is **remembered across restarts** (stored in MCP preferences); a fresh install defaults to **GATED** (fail safe). Turning the gate **off** requires a confirmation in Archi; turning it **on** is a single click. Approval mode is a single global switch (one human, one desktop, one gate), and the agent can read the current state via `get-model-info` (`approvalMode`).

**Pending Approvals view.** When approval mode is on, you review and apply the agent's queued changes in the **Pending Approvals** dock view inside Archi. Open it from **Window → Show View → MCP Server → Pending Approvals**, or from the **MCP Server → `Pending approvals (N)`** menu item (which also shows the live count). Each gated tool-call — including a whole `bulk-mutate` — is **one card**, showing a plain-language effect rollup with destructive counts (deletes/removals) called out in amber. **`Show changes`** expands the card to named, verb-prefixed rows (deletes hoisted to the top) with a `Technical details` disclosure for the raw parameters. **`Approve`** applies the change (a card containing a delete stays disabled until you expand it once); **`Reject`** discards it with no change to the model. Toolbar **`Approve all safe`** clears the purely-additive cards in one click, and **`Approve all ⚠`** drains everything after one confirmation that names the deletion count. New gated changes appear live without a refresh.

The card's effect text is **generated by the server from the model's own truth**, so you can decide from the card alone without opening `Technical details`: relationships name both endpoints (`Create ServingRelationship: 'Payment Gateway' → 'Fraud Engine'`, and a delete adds its cascade), and a `bulk-mutate` card's rows are named per operation (`+ Create "Payment Gateway" (ApplicationComponent)`, `↔ Connect "Payment Gateway" → "Fraud Engine" (ServingRelationship)`). Agents may pass an **optional `intent`** on `begin-batch` or `bulk-mutate` (a plain-language "why"); when present it shows as a quiet `agent's note:` line **below** the effect — it never replaces or outranks the server effect, and an empty or generic note is dropped. Effect is non-spoofable server ground truth; intent is a separate, lower-trust claim the server never depends on.

**Batch mode** groups mutations into atomic transactions:

```
begin-batch()
  → create-element(...)
  → create-relationship(...)
  → add-to-view(...)
end-batch()
  → All succeed together or all roll back
```

## Troubleshooting

**Server won't start**
- Check if port 18090 is already in use: `lsof -i :18090`
- Verify the bind address in preferences is valid

**LLM client can't connect**
- Confirm the server is running (menu shows "Stop MCP Server")
- Verify the port matches your client config
- Test connectivity: `curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18090/mcp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0"}}}'`

**Model appears empty**
- Ensure an ArchiMate model is open in Archi before connecting
- If the model was opened after the session started, reconnect the LLM client

**Mutations fail with validation error**
- Check the `archiMateReference` field in the error — it cites the relevant ArchiMate spec section
- Use `search-and-create` instead of `create-element` to avoid duplicates

**TLS connection issues**
- Verify the keystore file exists and the password is correct
- For self-signed certificates, ensure the client trusts the certificate or use `-k` with `curl`

**Troubleshooting: secure storage ("Secure storage unavailable" when saving the token or keystore password)**

The bearer token and the TLS keystore password are stored in Equinox secure storage, encrypted under an OS-protected master password (the **macOS Keychain** on Mac, the **Windows Credential Store / DPAPI** on Windows). If that OS-protected master password entry is lost or locked, saving fails with *"Secure storage unavailable."* This is an environment/credential-store state issue, not a data problem — the app **never** falls back to storing the secret in cleartext, and any value already configured is left untouched. (On macOS the underlying error in the log reads `SecurityException: Could not obtain password. Result: -25300`; on Windows it surfaces as a `StorageException` reporting the master password could not be obtained.)

To recover, reset secure storage so Equinox can create a fresh master password:

1. **Quit Archi.**
2. Move aside the secure-storage file (a backup, so it's reversible). It lives in the Archi instance area:
   - **macOS:**
     ```bash
     mv ~/Library/Application\ Support/Archi/secure_storage \
        ~/Library/Application\ Support/Archi/secure_storage.bak
     ```
   - **Windows** (PowerShell):
     ```powershell
     Move-Item "$env:APPDATA\Archi\secure_storage" "$env:APPDATA\Archi\secure_storage.bak"
     ```
   If the path differs on your setup, the exact location is shown in the `.metadata/.log` file referenced below.
3. **Restart Archi.** Equinox recreates the store automatically (you may get a one-time OS prompt to allow access to the Keychain / Credential Store — allow it).
4. Re-enter any secrets that lived in the old store: the **bearer token** (Generate / Regenerate in preferences), the **TLS keystore password** (re-type it or use Generate Self-Signed Certificate), and — if you use them — any other Archi credentials (e.g. coArchi model-repository logins).

> Note: Archi (unlike the full Eclipse IDE) does not expose the **Error Log** view in its menus on any platform. To read the full stack trace, open the `.metadata/.log` file inside your Archi instance area directly (`~/Library/Application Support/Archi/.metadata/.log` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\Archi\.metadata\.log` on Windows).

## Architecture Layers

The codebase enforces strict layer boundaries to keep concerns separated:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 1 — Protocol          server/, registry/     │
│  Only MCP SDK + Jetty types. No EMF imports.        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 2 — Handlers          handlers/              │
│  DTOs + ArchiModelAccessor interface only.           │
│  No EMF or SWT imports.                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 3 — Model             model/                 │
│  ONLY package that imports EMF / ArchimateTool.     │
│  Returns DTOs, never EObjects.                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 4 — UI                ui/                    │
│  SWT/Eclipse UI only. Preferences, menus, status.   │
│  Never blocks Jetty threads.                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key rule:** Handlers never see EMF objects. All model access goes through the `ArchiModelAccessor` interface, which returns DTOs.

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Transport

- **Dual transport:** Streamable-HTTP (`/mcp`) + SSE (`/sse`) for backward compatibility
- Each transport gets its own `McpSyncServer` instance
- `HttpServletStreamableServerTransportProvider` and `HttpServletSseServerTransportProvider` both extend `HttpServlet`

### Threading

- **Reads:** Direct EMF access from Jetty threads (thread-safe for read-only)
- **Mutations:** Dispatched to the SWT UI thread via `Display.syncExec()` for CommandStack consistency
- UI thread is never blocked by read operations

### Response Envelope

Every tool response follows a standard structure:

```json
{
  "result": { },
  "nextSteps": ["Use get-relationships to explore connections", "..."],
  "_meta": { "totalCount": 42, "isTruncated": false, "durationMs": 12 }
}
```

### Error Handling

Structured errors with actionable guidance:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Relationship type not valid between these elements",
    "details": "ServingRelationship requires ApplicationComponent as source",
    "suggestedCorrection": "Use an ApplicationComponent or change relationship type",
    "archiMateReference": "ArchiMate 3.2 § 5.1.2"
  }
}
```

### Mutation Pattern

All mutation tools use the `PreparedMutation<T>` pattern:
1. Validate inputs and build the command (on Jetty thread)
2. Dispatch execution to UI thread via `Display.syncExec()`
3. Execute through Archi's CommandStack (enables undo/redo)
4. Return result DTO

For connections, `redo()` must null-then-reconnect due to Archi's `connect()` early-return guard.

## Adding a New Tool

1. **Create or extend a handler** in `handlers/`
2. **Register the tool** in `registerTools()` — define the JSON schema, description, and call handler
3. **Add model access** if needed — new method on `ArchiModelAccessor` interface, implemented in `ArchiModelAccessorImpl` (returns DTOs, not EObjects)
4. **Format responses** using `ResponseFormatter` with the standard envelope
5. **Handle errors** — catch at the handler boundary, translate to structured `ErrorResponse`
6. **Write tests** — mock `ArchiModelAccessor` for handler tests (no EMF runtime needed)

## Testing

The test bundle (`net.vheerden.archi.mcp.tests`) is an OSGi fragment with `Fragment-Host: net.vheerden.archi.mcp`, giving it full access to main plugin classes.

- **Headless one-command run (recommended):** `tools/run-tests.sh` compiles both projects from source against your local Archi/Eclipse install and runs the headless-safe majority of the suite (~95% of classes), asserting `testsRun > 0` per class and emitting JUnit XML to `build/test-results/`. No Eclipse IDE, no hand-maintained class list — the run set is auto-discovered by scanning for `*Test.java` minus the exclusion manifest `tools/osgi-excluded-tests.txt`. See [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md). Override locations with `ARCHI_HOME` / `ECLIPSE_HOME` / `M2_REPO` (so CI can reuse the same script). Use `tools/run-tests.sh --swt <Class>` for SWT/display-required classes.
- **Run the OSGi-only bucket** in Eclipse as a single "JUnit Plug-in Test" (the `AllPluginTestsRunner` launch) — the OSGi runtime it provides is required for the classes the headless harness excludes (listed in `tools/osgi-excluded-tests.txt`). Individual classes can also be run one at a time.
- **Pure-Java tests** (geometry, layout algorithms, routing) can also run as standard JUnit tests without the Eclipse runtime
- Handler tests mock `ArchiModelAccessor` — no Archi installation needed
- **Tests requiring the Eclipse/OSGi runtime** — three classes touch Archi/Eclipse runtime singletons that only initialise under OSGi, so they **must** be run as a JUnit Plug-in Test (a headless JVM cannot initialise them and they are guarded to *skip* there rather than fail):
  - `McpPreferenceInitializerTest` — `org.eclipse.core.internal.preferences.ConfigurationPreferences`
  - `McpServerManagerTest` — `com.archimatetool.editor.model.IEditorModelManager`
  - `ArchiModelAccessorImplTest` (the two specialization-relationship cases) — `com.archimatetool.model.util.RelationshipsMatrix`

## PDE Build Notes

This is a pure Eclipse PDE project — no Maven or Gradle. Key files:

- `MANIFEST.MF` — OSGi bundle metadata, `Bundle-ClassPath` lists all JARs
- `build.properties` — PDE build includes
- `.classpath` — Eclipse project classpath

When adding a new JAR dependency, update **three places**: the `lib/` directory, `MANIFEST.MF` `Bundle-ClassPath`, and `.classpath`.
